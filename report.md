 I found that total tweets with a cashtag is a good proxy for the price of $OCEAN. Although the sentiment model was fairly accurate, many tweets do not encode strong sentiment or just encode price moves, making this sentiment model not predictive. There are probably better models for predicting crypto price sentiment from twitter data, but they would need to train on specialized language and possibly take into account the tweet that was being replied to. Also, it's possible a better index could be created rather than a weighted average of sentiment based upon likes or views.

 Likes, total tweets, total retweets, and unique ids are all basically interchangeable in terms of their predictive value. Likes showed the best performance, but total tweets with a cashtag is more intuitive although perhaps more gameable signal. It was not possible to tease apart the effect of influential tweets on price moves since influential tweets will also cause more retweets, tweets, and likes. It might be possible to react quickly to trade onvery influential tweets, but this would not show up in daily data.
